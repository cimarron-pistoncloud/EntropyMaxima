Entropy Maxima
"The Entropy Maximum is a corollary of the Energy minimum" David Chandler
"but there are many local maxima, just like there multiple local minima." Noel Carrascal

To branch, pull and merge files from a local branch to
the remote master on github.com, I used the follwoing articla
as a guide: https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401

To INSTALL the program in a unic=x environment type:

sudo python setup.py install

The above command minus the sudo will probably work on
Mac and window's command prompt, but it has not been tested.
